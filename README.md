# VRROOMe

**Vector Resonant Relaxation Out Of Maximum entropy**

Supermassive black holes dominate the gravitational potential in their surrounding stellar cluster. In these dense environments, stars follow nearly Keplerian orbits which see their orbital plane relax through the potential fluctuations generated by the stellar cluster itself. For typical astrophysical galactic nuclei, the most likely outcome of this vector resonant relaxation (VRR) is that the orientations of the most massive stars spontaneously self-align within a narrow disc. We present a maximum entropy code  to  determine the long-term axisymmetric distribution of orientations stemming from VRR.

## Installation

You will need to install Julia, by following the instructions at ` https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/ `\
To invoke Julia in the terminal, you will need to make sure that the Julia command-line program is in your ` PATH `

You will also need to install the following Julia packages:
- Distributions
- Plots
- PlotlyJS
- Interpolations
- HDF5
- StaticArrays
- FastGaussQuadrature
- Random
- LinearAlgebra

**WARNING: Do NOT interrupt the installation of the packages!**

## Testing the installation with the example script

Once all of this is done, you can test if everything is ready by running the file ` Code/Example.jl ` ideally from your IDE of choice (Atom, VS Code, ...), or in the REPL

> ` >>> julia `\
> ` julia> include("Code/Example.jl") `

or in the terminal

> ` >>>  julia Code.Example.jl `

After a few minutes, it should produce:

> ` Starting -- Julia seems to be working. `\
> \
> ` Let's first create an initial cluster, with 16 star formation events `\
> ` WARNING: using Distributions.scale in module Main conflicts with an existing identifier. `\
> ` We can compute this cluster's binding energy E and spin s `\
> ` The cluster has been created and its (E, s) computed `\
> ` Now let's plot it `\
> \
> ` Now let's create the initial DF related to this initial cluster `\
> ` WARNING: redefinition of constant TAB_INT_SL. This may fail, cause incorrect answers, or produce other errors. `\
> ` The initial DF related to the initial cluster has been created `\
> \
> ` Let's modify this DF so that it maximizes the entropy S `\
> ` true `\
> ` The entropy has been maximized `\
> ` Finally, let's plot the final DF `

It should also display 2 plots, which should be perfect replicas of ` Figures/Initial_cluster.png ` and ` Figures/Relaxed_cluster.png `:

` Figures/Initial_cluster.png ` | ` Figures/Relaxed_cluster.png `

## First steps

The ` Code/Example.jl ` has been designed to provide examples of the commands I find the most useful.\
Please read through it to get started.

## Advanced usage

The more advanced reader might feel the need to play with lower-level functions. Please do so, they are all in the ` Code/ ` folder.\
The functions are documented within the code itself. But should my comments be unsufficient, please send me an e-mail at ` nathan.magnan@maths.cam.ac.uk ` for clarifications.

## Usage in research

Should you use VROOMe for research, we invite you to cite the paper **To Be Completed once it is published**.
